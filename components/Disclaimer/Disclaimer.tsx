        *** All data gathered from within this application will be encrypted
        using the encryption key you generated at the beginning of the process.
        This data can not be decrypted by us once a verification NFT is minted
        in connection to it.

      <p>
        *** The data gathered here can be used to identify anyone involved in
        scamming, defrauding, or stealing from their communities. The threshold

        * A DAO vote is held to determine whether or not the project has indeed
        scammed, defrauded, or stolen from its community.
      </p>
      <p>
        * If the DAO returns a “Yes” vote to the above question, that then
        triggers another vote. * Warn the project; 24-hour timer begins for the
        project to right it’s wrongs. OR * Decrypt the project’s identity data.
      </p>
      <p>
        * If the project’s identity data is decrypted, a third vote is held to
        determine how the identity data would best be used to return the capital
        to the community. This could very well include law enforcement
        responsible for prosecuting fraud, computer crimes, etc.

        *** WDOX DAO exist’s to protect developer’s identities when building; no
        one deserves to have the public breathing down their neck because they
        didn’t do what someone else wanted them to do. No one. No one should be
        threatened, attacked, harassed because of the way they run their own
        projects. We are here to protect developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, we are also here to protect the community from
        scammers, fraudsters, and thieves. Every single person within Web3 has
        been touched by some form of scam, and because there is zero
        accountability, it continues to happen. We are not the moral, ethical,
        legal, or artistic police. This is a free space, and the data is truly
        owned by the community, not us. We are tired of the community being
        scammed; we are tired of developers being harassed. Putting these
        identity documents in a vault offers the community an insurance policy.
        Our data collection, and storage, is THE MOST important thing to our
        project. All data is stored off-chain, encrypted by your generated key,
        and locked forever once a verification is complete. This means that the
        key is “burned” or “destroyed” upon minting the NFT for your project’s
        verification. It will only be accessible to the DAO, and only after
        three separate votes ensuring a scam has taken place.
