            It’s become a toxic space, and that’s unfortunate when the potential
            for real change is considered. The space has become synonymous with
            scams. We use phrases like “rug pull” and “honey pot” way too often,
            and this inhibits main stream adoption. The same holds true for the
            NFT space. Developers are hired or outsourced from freelance sites,
            and scams emerge. Often, a project born in good faith is left to die
            when the team behind it earns untold amounts of money after minting
            out, and then they continue to pull in royalties from secondary
            sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the current space, scammers are almost incentivized to lead mass
            marketing campaigns, hire a developer, an artist, and launch a
            project. If the project does well, and volume is high on secondary
            marketplaces, then the project should feel compelled to deliver on
            their “Roadmap.” Having said that, it’s become irrelevant to 90% of
            the project leaders in the space.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the project does poorly, or is announced a scam, the developers
            of said project still reap the secondary sales royalties, and
            sometimes with even greater volume, as people try to escape its
            downward spiral. This is plaguing our space. The creation of NFTs,
            and even crypto tokens, has become plug-and-play easy. Project
            leaders do not need a single scrap of blockchain experience or
            frontend development skill; so long as they have the ability to
            finance the project’s creation, they stand to make millions of
            dollars. The expression many use within the crypto space is “Wild
            West”, and in a sense, we are all correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            This space is largely unregulated, and will be for some time to
            come. Most of us, especially those that have been around for a while
            are believers in a free market, financial freedom, or the right to
            privacy. We believe that in order for NFTs - utility and art based -
            to becomes mainstream, for crypto-currencies to catch fiat in a real
            way, for innovation within the entire sphere to help fix the
            problems that exist - we need real regulation, and we need it to
            come from within. Regulation WILL come from world governments. They
            will over-regulate, and stifle innovation. It’s not a matter of
            what, but of when. They will hire so-called experts, and those
            experts will make things incredibly difficult for new projects,
            novel ideas, or revolutionary breakthroughs to happen.
          </p>

            This is a space built on decentralization, and this needs to
            continue in order for it to be sustainable. Regulating through
            identity disclosure, and fear of public and/or legal reprisal is one
            of the best ways for our space to regulate itself. The trouble is,
            until now, that’s a relatively dangerous and/or nerve wracking task.
          </p>
          <p>
            All too often project developers simply do not want to document
            their identity. The reasons vary, but something as simple as working
            for a major technology company, or being known in the space from
            another project - whether successful or not - could hold back a
            project, and therefore, slow innovation. Developers could come from
            a privacy background, or could have watched first hand how easy it
            can be to have their identities stolen, or their lives flipped
            upside down. A hypothetical, real-life Satoshi Nakamoto wouldn’t be
            able to buy a gallon of milk without being stalked and harassed
            endlessly. Vitalik Buterin is an international celebrity. Sergei
            Nazarov is a celebrity within the crypto space, and has thousands of
            “Marines” hanging on his every word.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developers of large, successful projects will always have incentive
            to publicly identify themselves. This is especially true when it
            becomes their primary source of income. Not so for the risk on
            projects that could, on one hand, fail miserably. Or, on the other
            hand, they could change finance, leasing, ticketing, etc. as we know
            it. Today, those of us in this space hear, or read, “un-doxxed team”
            and we try to convince ourselves that it’s going to be okay. We do
            our diligence, and we think... “well, SHIBA was created anonymously;
            Bitcoin was created anonymously; Bored Ape Yacht Club was created
            anonymously”... but in reality, we are terrified. Most of us are
            already psychologically out of the project before its begun. It’s
            just become too risky in a space full of scams.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a core team of six from all across the world; spread over
            four continents, and 5 timezones. When I put the project together, I
            was looking for a specific set of qualities amongst all new hires. I
            wanted the new hires to become team members, not employees. I wanted
            them all to believe in the possibility that a single project could
            help clean up Web3. We’ve all, at some point or another, been the
            victim of an outright scam, a “slow-rug” scam, a “honey pot”, or
            even a complete wallet wipe-out scam. It has to stop. There has to
            be some barrier to entry, and it has to be done in a way that’s not
            going to stifle innovation, or keep otherwise great developers from
            building within Web3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make no mistake, Web3 - NFTs, crypto, DAOs - are the future of the
            global financial system, and finance is only one of countless
            industries that will be revolutionized by the blockchain. We believe
            that in order for this to happen, we need to regulate the space from
            within. Government overregulation is hardly conducive to innovation.
