# About
This is a NextJS 12 React 18 Typescript website, using Cypress for testing. It uses Instanbul code coverage if you switch to babel (by unspoiling the .babel.rc file), and has MUI and Fontawesome integrated.

# Note
You will have to force most of the npm installs, since many libraries don't fully support React 18 yet
